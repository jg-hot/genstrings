strings:

# strings.yaml is designed to be easy to read and write:
- name: "hello"
  text: Welcome to the App!

# Escape sequences are not required. This will be post-processed properly.
- name: "no_worries"
  text: You don't have to worry about "escape" sequences anymore.

# You can add context and instructions like this:
- name: "submit_button"
  text: Submit
  context: >
    This text appears on a button with limited space. Try to keep it under 8 characters
    if possible.

- name: "pro_brand_name"
  text: My Awesome App Pro
  context: >
    My Awesome App is a brand name, keep it as is. Translate the rest of the string as usual.

# It's also easy to add positional arguments. These will be post processed -> i.e. %1$s
- name: "format_args"
  text: You will be charged {1} each {2}.

  # You can optionally declare a type specifier, which defaults to "s"
  format_args:
    - position: 1
      type: "f"

# You can add also add context to individual positional arguments:
- name: "contextual_format_args"
  text: What's your favorite {1} {2}?

  format_args:
    - position: 1
      context: Refers to an adjective
    - position: 2
      context: Refers to a noun

# Create non-translatable strings like this:
- name: "api_key"
  text: "f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6"
  translatable: false

# Add multiline strings using a plain .yaml multi-line block:
- name: "multi_line"
  translatable: false
  text: |
    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
    
    The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
    
    Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
    
    Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

# Trailing newlines will be stripped. If you want a trailing new line, just add \n at the end.
